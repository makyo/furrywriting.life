FWLife is a host for projects that furry writers would like to run. For example, if you have an idea for a flash-fiction project with a certain theme driving it you can come up with a name (say, "Flash Fiction for Foxes"), a url (say, `flashfic4foxes.furrywriting.flie`), and a means for submission, then you can let others submit and post the results to the site.

Although this spun out of the Furry Writers' Guild, it's open to everyone!
